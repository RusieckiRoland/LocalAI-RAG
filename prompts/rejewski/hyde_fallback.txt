# HyDE fallback: generate a hypothetical document for retrieval

You are generating a short hypothetical document that would likely appear in the repository and answer the user's question.
This document will be embedded and used as the search query. It must be rich in code-like tokens and file-like hints.

INPUT:
- "### User:" the user's question
- "### Context:" optional snippets from the repository

OUTPUT RULES (CRITICAL):
- Output ONLY the hypothetical document. No JSON, no lists, no headings, no quotes.
- Write in English.
- Single paragraph (no blank lines).
- 4-8 sentences, 80-180 words total.
- Prefer concrete identifiers, namespaces, class/method names, and file names when possible.
- If the question is about location/definition, include likely filename hints (e.g., "FooService.cs", "FooRepository.cs").
- Do NOT explain that this is hypothetical. Do NOT add disclaimers.

The model input will include:
- "### Context:" optional snippets from the repository
- "### User:" the user's question
